# Flipkart Grid 6.0 - Smart Vision Technology Quality Control Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code developed for the **Smart Vision Technology Quality Control** project, which aims to revolutionize quality testing in e-commerce using advanced camera vision technology. The project focuses on automating the quality inspection process by identifying products, assessing their quantity, and detecting defects or quality attributes.

## Project Description

The Smart Vision Technology Quality Control system is designed to enhance the quality assurance processes for one of Indiaâ€™s largest e-commerce companies. By utilizing high-resolution imaging and sophisticated algorithms, the system can accurately evaluate both the quality and quantity of shipments, ensuring that customers receive only the best products.

## Features

- **Image Acquisition**: High-resolution cameras with controlled lighting capture clear images of products.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Normalizes images for consistency and applies filters to enhance features.
- **Feature Extraction**: Implements Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text detection and uses object detection algorithms to identify defects.
- **Classification and Decision-Making**: Utilizes machine learning models to classify products based on extracted features.
- **Output and Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on product quality and logs data for continuous improvement.
- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Seamlessly connects with inventory management systems for automated handling based on quality evaluations.
- **Roboflow Integration**: Utilizes the Roboflow API for model deployment, enabling efficient image processing and product recognition through pre-trained models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- NumPy
- PyZbar
- SQLite3
- Roboflow API (for model inference)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imAryanSingh/Smart-Vision-Technology-Quality-Control.git
   cd Smart-Vision-Technology-Quality-Control
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure all necessary hardware components (like cameras) are connected and configured correctly.

4. Set up your Roboflow account and obtain an API key to access pre-trained models.

## Usage

1. **Project Details**:
   The application provides an overview of its objectives and key features, showcasing how it aims to automate quality inspections.

2. **Solution Summary**:
   This section details how advanced imaging technologies are utilized for quality control in e-commerce.

3. **Freshness Index**:
   Users can upload images of fruits and vegetables to assess their freshness based on visual analysis.

4. **Product Recognition**:
   The system identifies products from uploaded images using machine learning models trained on various product categories via Roboflow's API.

5. **Detail Extraction**:
   This feature extracts relevant information from product images using OCR techniques.

6. **Count Fruits & Vegetables**:
   Users can count items within an uploaded image using object detection algorithms.

To run the project, execute the main script:
```bash
streamlit run main2nd.py
```

## State Machine

The application operates in various states depending on user interactions:
- **INITIALIZING**: Sets up the application and loads necessary models.
- **IMAGE_UPLOAD**: Allows users to upload images for analysis.
- **PROCESSING**: Analyzes uploaded images for freshness, recognition, or detail extraction.
- **RESULT_DISPLAY**: Shows results from the analysis back to the user.
